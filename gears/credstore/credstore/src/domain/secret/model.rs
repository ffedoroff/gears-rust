// Updated: 2026-10-06 by Constructor Tech
//! Domain models for secret metadata and write concurrency (ADR-0006:
//! immutable value versions).
//!
//! Models the two resting statuses (`active`/`declared`), the fallback
//! policy, the value-version pointer and optimistic preconditions, all
//! persisted separately from secret values.
