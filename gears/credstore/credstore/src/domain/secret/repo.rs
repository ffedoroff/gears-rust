// Updated: 2026-10-06 by Constructor Tech
//! Persistence port for secret metadata, value-pointer switching and the
//! write-intent journal (ADR-0006: immutable value versions).
//!
//! Every pointer switch is ONE database compare-and-set on the row `version`.
//! Every store side effect is either announced before it happens (a write
//! intent, [`SecretRepo::begin_write_intent`]) or recorded as a cleanup debt
//! in the same transaction that learned it is needed: the methods that change
//! a row or retire an intent pair that change with the [`CleanupDebt`]s it
//! implies, atomically. Executing a debt is the caller's job, after the
//! commit is confirmed ([`SecretRepo::delete_debt`] removes it afterwards).
