//! Pure hierarchy reduction: turning every visible row of one reference into
//! a single effective outcome (ADR-0005, "Reducing a reference to one item").
//!
//! Shared, verbatim, by the point read
//! ([`crate::domain::secret::service::Service::resolve_credential`]) and the
//! collection read
//! ([`crate::domain::secret::service::Service::list`](../service/list/index.html))
//! so a change to visibility/priority rules cannot apply to one and miss the
//! other (ADR-0005, D3). Takes no [`crate::domain::secret::service::Service`]
//! state — it is a function of the candidate rows and the caller's tenant
//! chain alone, which is what lets it be called from either place without
//! threading `Service`'s private fields through a module boundary.
