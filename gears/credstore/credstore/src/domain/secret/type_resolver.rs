// Updated: 2026-10-06 by Constructor Tech
//! Registry-driven secret-type resolution — the runtime source of truth
//! for a secret type's PDP resource id and enforceable traits.
//!
//! Secrets store their type as the deterministic v5 UUID of the type's GTS
//! id (`credstore_sdk::type_uuid`). Every operation resolves that UUID
//! against the GTS types-registry to recover the full type id (the PDP
//! resource the single authz evaluation targets) and the effective traits
//! the write path enforces. New secret types are added by registering a
//! GTS schema derived from `gts.cf.core.credstore.credential.v1~` — no
//! credstore release involved; the compiled-in catalog only seeds the
//! built-in schemas.
//!
//! This module owns the **trait abstraction**; the production
//! implementation ([`crate::infra::types_registry::GtsSecretTypeResolver`])
//! wraps `types_registry_sdk::TypesRegistryClient` resolved from
//! `ClientHub`. The resolver deliberately holds no cache of its own: the
//! registry's local client already keeps a TTL cache of `Arc<GtsTypeSchema>`
//! keyed by id and UUID, so a per-operation resolve is one cached lookup.
