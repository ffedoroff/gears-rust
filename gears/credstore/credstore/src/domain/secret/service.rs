// Updated: 2026-10-06 by Constructor Tech
//! Credential-store domain service (ADR-0006: immutable value versions).
//!
//! Orchestrates authorization, typed-secret validation, hierarchy resolution
//! and the immutable-value write/read/delete protocols. Every side effect on
//! the value store is either announced in the database before it happens
//! (a write intent, inserted before `plugin.put`) or recorded as a cleanup
//! debt in the same transaction that learned it is needed (older versions
//! after a rotation, an unreferenced version after a lost write, a whole key
//! after a delete), and executed by the request that recorded it once the
//! commit is confirmed. There is no background work: the leftovers of an
//! interrupted request (an unexecuted debt, an expired intent) are healed by
//! a later request that touches the same record or reference ("Heal on
//! access", DESIGN section 6.2).
