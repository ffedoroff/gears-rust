// Updated: 2026-10-06 by Constructor Tech
//! Metrics vocabulary and recording port for credential-store operations.
//!
//! Defines bounded labels for outcomes and dependencies, plus the lifecycle
//! counters of ADR-0006: the write-intent counters
//! (`write_intents_healed`, `write_intent_lost`, `write_intent_settle_failed`),
//! the store-cleanup counters (`store_cleanup_recorded`,
//! `store_cleanup_failed`, by debt op), `write_commit_verified` (the
//! verification after an ambiguous commit) and `read_retry`. No inventory gauges: the shipped reaper's per-status
//! row-count gauges were `COUNT … GROUP BY` queries, forbidden by the
//! platform's no-`COUNT` rule, and are withdrawn rather than reimplemented.
