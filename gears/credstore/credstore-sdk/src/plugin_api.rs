// Updated: 2026-10-06 by Constructor Tech
//! Backend storage-plugin contract (ADR-0006: immutable value versions).
//!
//! A plugin is a versioned key-value store keyed by `(tenant_id, record_id)`
//! ([`StoreKey`]); the gear chooses the key and the plugin only maps it to a
//! physical location under its installation prefix. Every `put` creates a new
//! immutable version and returns the provider's identifier of it
//! ([`ValueVersion`]); the gear stores that in the metadata row and passes it
//! back verbatim. The plugin learns nothing about references, owners, types or
//! sharing, and the request context is used for correlation only, never for
//! authorization.
//!
//! Three operations are required of every backend (`put`, `get`,
//! `delete_key`); `destroy` is optional and declared through
//! [`CredStorePluginClientV2::supports_destroy`]. The gear never calls
//! `destroy` on a plugin that does not declare it. It issues `delete_key` and
//! `destroy` as recorded cleanup obligations: right after the commit that made
//! the content dead, or later, when a request that touches the same record
//! finds the obligation still pending. A call may therefore be repeated and
//! may arrive at any later time (hence the idempotency below).
//!
//! Guarantees required of a backend: **durability** (`put` returns only after
//! the bytes are durable), **exact bytes** (`get` returns exactly the bytes of
//! the `put` that returned the version, or `None`), **idempotent
//! `delete_key`/`destroy`**. **Ordered versions per key** (a `put` that starts
//! after another `put` on the same key has returned gets a greater version)
//! are required only together with `destroy`. Not required: CAS, listing,
//! cross-key transactions.
