//! Port for the raw HTTP exchange with the Vault / `OpenBao` REST API.
//!
//! The domain [`Service`](super::Service) builds fully-resolved requests (URL,
//! verb, JSON body) and classifies the plain status/body pairs it gets back;
//! it never names an HTTP client. The `reqwest`-backed implementation lives in
//! `crate::infra::http` and is injected at gear initialisation, which keeps
//! this layer free of infrastructure crates and lets the service be driven by
//! any other transport.
//!
//! The transport owns everything that is per-connection rather than
//! per-request: timeouts, TLS, and the authentication / namespace headers
//! (`X-Vault-Token`, `X-Vault-Namespace`), including re-reading a rotated
//! token after a `403`. The token therefore never reaches the domain layer.
