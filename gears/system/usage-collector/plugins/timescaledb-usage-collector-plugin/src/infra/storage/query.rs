/// This is a **defense-in-depth backstop**, not the primary cap: the
/// usage-collector core gateway already rejects `$top > 1000` with
/// `400 InvalidArgument` (its own `MAX_PAGE_SIZE`) before any plugin call.
/// The value is kept in lock-step with that gateway cap so this clamp is
/// never reached in normal operation — it only bites if the plugin is ever
/// driven by a different or buggy caller, preventing an unbounded
/// full-result-set read (a resource/DoS hazard) at the persistence boundary.

/// (`requested`) when present, else `default_page_size`, clamped to the
/// `[1, MAX_PAGE_SIZE]` range.
///
/// Clamping (rather than rejecting) is correct here because the plugin is
/// pure persistence and must not own HTTP-policy `4xx`s — the reject already
/// lives in the core. Keyset pagination degrades gracefully under a clamp:
/// the look-ahead + `next_cursor` still yield a correct, resumable page, just
/// a smaller one than an out-of-contract caller asked for.
///
/// The **lower** bound of 1 guards against `requested == Some(0)` reaching
/// this function (ML-5024). That path is closed for HTTP callers: there is
/// no `$top` field on the core gateway's `OData` extractor at all, and the
/// gateway's `limit` is resolved through `toolkit_odata::resolve_page_size`,
/// which rejects `limit=0` outright before any plugin dispatch. It is
/// **not** closed for in-process callers: `UsageCollectorLocalClient`
/// (`usage-collector/src/domain/local_client.rs`) implements
/// `UsageCollectorClientV1::list_usage_records` by forwarding the caller's
/// `ODataQuery` straight to `Service::list_usage_records`
/// (`domain/service.rs`), which runs `require_bounded_time_window` and
/// `compose_query_with_scope` (`domain/query.rs`) — neither touches
/// `limit` — before dispatching to this plugin's SPI. A caller on that
/// path that builds `ODataQuery::new().with_limit(0)` directly still
/// arrives here with `requested == Some(0)`, so this floor is a live guard
/// for that path, not a leftover: a resolved page size of 0 would drive
/// `LIMIT 0+1 = 1` then `truncate(0)` on the look-ahead read — leaving
/// `rows.last()` `None` on a non-empty table and 500-ing both list paths
/// at `encode_next_cursor`. Flooring to the smallest legal page (1) keeps
/// the look-ahead invariant intact without the plugin minting a `4xx`.
